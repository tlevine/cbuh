Dada contacts
=================
Install Xapian and cbuh. In Arch Linux, I do this.

    sudo pacman -S python2-xapian
    sudo pip2 install cbuh

Save your contacts in ``~/.cbuh/contacts`` with the following format.

    [thomas.levine]
    name = Thomas Levine
    email = _@thomaslevine.com
    phone = +1 831 713 1131
    place = Scarsdale, New York
    place = Ithaca, New York
    place = New York, New York
    place = Oakland, California
    place = Berlin, Germany

    [someone.else]
    email = someone@dada.pink
    # ...

For the commands, run ``cbuh -h``.
